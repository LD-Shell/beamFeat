# Getting started with beamfeat

beamfeat constructs interpretable features from tabular data. Given columns
`a`, `b`, and `c`, it searches expressions like `log(a)`, `a * b`, and
`(a * b) / c`, keeps the ones that predict the target, and reports them as
readable formulas.

Two things distinguish it from exhaustive feature engineering:

1. **The search is guided.** Candidates are scored against the target and only
   the best are extended, so cost does not compound with expression depth.
2. **Selection is calibrated.** The retained features carry a false discovery
   rate guarantee rather than surviving a heuristic threshold.

This notebook covers the basic workflow. Later notebooks cover the search and
selection machinery in detail.

both scientifically important. First, FDR is an **expectation**: individual
trials may exceed the level, and a mean over 15 trials carries visible Monte
Carlo noise, so values a little above nominal are consistent with control.
Second, an exact test *spends* its error budget — realised FDR near nominal
is the signature of a calibrated procedure, where a realised FDR pinned at
zero would signal wasted power.

## Knockoffs: two constructions, two sets of assumptions

The knockoff filter comes in two forms, and it matters which one you mean.

**Fixed-X knockoffs** (Barber & Candès, 2015) treat the design as fixed and
make *no assumption about the distribution of the features* — deterministic
engineered columns are admissible. The guarantee needs `n >= 2p` and Gaussian
noise in `y = Xβ + ε`. Its weakness on engineered designs is **power,
not validity**: near-duplicate columns drive the construction's `s` toward
zero, the knockoffs become nearly identical to the originals, and the filter
loses the ability to tell them apart.

**Model-X knockoffs** (Candès et al., 2018) instead assume the features are
jointly Gaussian — which engineered features are not: `log(a)` and `a * b`
are deterministic functions of shared parents. beamfeat only uses this
construction when `n < 2p`, where fixed-X does not exist, and warns.

beamfeat routes between the two automatically and reports which assumptions
are under strain, rather than pretending otherwise.

One thing knockoffs will *not* do, since the conditional null invites the
inference: they cannot prune a term out of an expression. Selection operates
on whole candidate columns, so a candidate like `noise + (a * b) / c` is one
column and is accepted or rejected entire — switching the selector does not
reach inside it. Constraining what gets *built* is the lever there, and
notebook 04 uses units for exactly that.

One further caveat, measured rather than assumed: the `offset` parameter
dominates knockoff power on narrow designs. `offset=1` (knockoff+) requires
`(1 + #negatives) / #positives <= target_fdr`, which cannot be satisfied when
there are fewer than `1 / target_fdr` features, regardless of signal strength.

`(H / eta) * (Q * rho)` is `rho * Q * H / eta` — the physics, exactly, with

### Where did gravity go?

It is in the coefficient. `g` never varies, so no expression containing it can
be distinguished from the same expression without it: `rho * g` is just
`9.81 * rho`, perfectly collinear with `rho`, and the redundancy pass keeps one
representative of the pair. The scaling then lands in the linear model, which
is why the fitted coefficient reads 9.79 rather than 1.

This generalises. A multiplicative constant is absorbed into the coefficient
rather than recovered as a symbol, so its absence from the formula is not a
miss. Check the coefficient before concluding a factor was lost.

for an equation nobody can read.

### Why the flag is still True

This is the single most important thing to understand about the guarantee, and
it is not a defect.

The null being tested is **marginal**: is this expression, *as a whole*,
independent of the target? An expression that combines the true core with a
noise column is emphatically not independent of the target — the core sees to
that — so its null is false and selecting it is not an error under the
criterion. The guarantee certifies that a selected formula is not pure noise.
It does not certify that every column inside it earns its place.

So `fdr_controlled_ = True` means what it says, and it is not the property you
wanted here. Noise hitchhikes on a strong signal.
        """
    ),
    markdown(

## Depth is not the number of variables

The instinct that sent us to `max_depth=3` was wrong arithmetic. Depth counts
*composition levels*, not variables, and a binary operator combines any two
surviving expressions — not a variable onto a chain.

So `rho * Q * H / eta`, four variables, is depth **two**:

| depth | built |
|---|---|
| 1 | `(Q * H)` and `(eta / rho)` |
| 2 | `(Q * H) / (eta / rho)` |

The default reached it on the first try. The extra level bought no accuracy and
gave the search room to decorate a finished answer with noise. Raise `max_depth`
when a target you expect is *not* being recovered, never speculatively: a deeper
search enlarges the candidate pool, every threshold scales as 1/m, and each
extra candidate costs power on the ones that matter.

coherent, not that it matches the target's dimension. `rho * Q * H / eta` is
