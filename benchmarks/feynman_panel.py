"""Feynman-equation panel for beamfeat.

Twelve physics equations spanning what a depth-limited, constant-free
symbolic feature space can and cannot represent, evaluated the way the
symbolic-regression community evaluates (SRBench): a problem counts as
*solved* at held-out R^2 > 0.999 under 0.1% noise. A second, stricter
criterion is reported alongside: *exact form*, meaning the fitted equation's
dominant term is the generating expression itself, checked by constructing
the expected expression through beamfeat's own node API and comparing
canonical names — so commutative reordering and algebraic rewrites are
handled by the same normalisation the library applies to its candidates.

Four problems are included as expected failures, each marking a documented
boundary: the Gaussian and Planck-style forms need ``exp`` (available but not
a default operator; the panel reports both configurations), relativistic
velocity addition needs a literal constant inside the expression, and the 2D
distance formula needs depth-4 nesting.

Run with ``python benchmarks/feynman_panel.py``. Results are written to
``benchmarks/feynman_results.json``.
