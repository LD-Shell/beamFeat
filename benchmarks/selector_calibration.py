"""Selector-level calibration: realised FDR, power, and the pure-noise stress.

Measures every selector-level number quoted in README.md, docs/guarantees.md
and the paper, so that none of them is asserted without a script that produces
it. Three studies, all on Gaussian designs (n=300, 25 candidate features, 5 of
them signal, effect 3.0, unit noise):

1. Permutation selector, Benjamini-Hochberg and Benjamini-Yekutieli, at
   nominal FDR 0.05 / 0.10 / 0.20 -- realised FDR and power over 25 trials.
2. Fixed-X knockoffs at nominal 0.20, with offset=1 (knockoff+, controls FDR)
   and offset=0 (controls only a modified FDR).
3. A global-null stress on the full pipeline: 25 pure-noise problems, BH
   against BY. Under a global null every selection is false, so the mean
   false discovery proportion equals the fraction of trials selecting
   anything; this is the measurement behind the BY estimator default.

Monte Carlo error at 25 trials is substantial -- roughly +/-0.03-0.06 on a
realised FDR, and a difference of one or two trials in study 3 is not
statistically meaningful. Read the numbers as calibration evidence, not as
point estimates.

    Benjamini-Hochberg controls the FDR at ``q * m0/m``, where ``m0`` of the

    is stricter by a harmonic factor, so the practical claim for it is simply
    that the realised rate stays at or below nominal. Both bounds are derived
    from the design constants above rather than written in by hand, and the
    Monte Carlo error is reported so the figures are read at the precision the
