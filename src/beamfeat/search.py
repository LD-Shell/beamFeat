"""Target-guided beam search over the expression DAG.

Exhaustive expansion is the scaling failure of breadth-first feature
construction: the candidate count compounds at every depth, and the cost is
paid in full before any of it is scored. This module instead expands only a
bounded frontier. At each depth, every surviving expression is extended by the
available operators, the resulting candidates are scored against the target,
and only the best ``beam_width`` survive to be extended again.

Two properties keep the beam useful rather than merely small:

**Marginal scoring.** Candidates are scored against the residual left by the
features already selected, not against the raw target. A candidate that merely
restates an incumbent scores near zero regardless of how strongly it correlates
with the target on its own.

**Redundancy pruning.** Even with marginal scoring, a beam can fill with
mutually correlated variants of one expression. Before a candidate is admitted,
its correlation against everything already admitted in that round is checked,
and it is dropped if it exceeds ``redundancy_threshold``.

Search is deterministic: given the same data, parameters, and ``random_state``,
the returned features and their order are identical across runs.

            enough for wide beams; see

        problem_type: ``"regression"`` or ``"classification"``.
        max_depth: Maximum expression depth. Depth 1 permits single transforms
            and pairwise combinations of inputs; each further depth composes on
            the results of the last.
        beam_width: Expressions retained at each depth. This is the parameter

        max_features: Maximum features returned. Defaults to ``beam_width``.
        unary_ops: Unary operators to apply. Defaults to log, sqrt, reciprocal,

            depth, as a guard against a wide beam and many operators producing
            an unaffordable round. Candidates beyond the ceiling are not
