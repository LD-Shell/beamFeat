"""Scikit-learn compatible estimators.

Three classes are provided:

:class:`BeamFeatTransformer`
    Constructs features and returns them. Composes into any scikit-learn
    pipeline, which is the usual way to combine beamfeat with an arbitrary
    downstream model.

:class:`BeamFeatRegressor` / :class:`BeamFeatClassifier`
    Construct features and fit a linear model on them. The point is not the
    linear model's accuracy but that its coefficients are readable: the fitted
    object exposes a closed-form expression for what it learned, which a
    gradient-boosted model on raw features cannot.

All three fit in two stages. Features are constructed and scored by
:class:`~beamfeat.search.BeamSearch`, then filtered by a
:class:`~beamfeat.selection.Selector` so the retained set carries an FDR
guarantee rather than a heuristic cut. Both stages see only the training data
passed to :meth:`fit`; :meth:`transform` replays the selected expressions
without re-searching, so a pipeline cross-validated in the usual way does not
leak.
