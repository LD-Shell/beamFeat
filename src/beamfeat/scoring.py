"""Candidate scoring strategies for guided beam search.

A :class:`Scorer` answers one question: how useful is this candidate feature,
given the target and the features already selected? The "given the features
already selected" part is what keeps a beam from filling with near-duplicates
of the same underlying signal, which is the dominant failure mode of scoring
candidates in isolation.

Three strategies are provided, trading signal quality against cost:

:class:`CorrelationScorer`
    Absolute Pearson correlation against the residual left by the incumbent
    features. Cheapest by a wide margin; detects only monotone-linear
    relationships to the residual, but that is often enough to *find* a feature
    whose nonlinearity is already baked into its expression.

:class:`MutualInformationScorer`
    Nearest-neighbour mutual information between candidate and residual.
    Detects nonmonotone dependence that correlation misses, at roughly one to
    two orders of magnitude more compute.

:class:`GradientBoostingScorer`
    Measured out-of-fold improvement in predictive performance when the
    candidate is added to the incumbent set. The most faithful signal, since it
    scores what is actually being optimised, and the most expensive.

All scorers are deterministic given a ``random_state``, and all handle the
empty-incumbent case (the first beam round, where there is no residual yet) by
scoring against the raw target.

    For classification, mutual information is computed against the class labels
