## Sixty seconds to a vetted equation

```python
import numpy as np
from beamfeat import BeamFeatRegressor

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
X = rng.uniform(1, 6, (400, 4))
y = X[:, 0] * X[:, 1] + rng.normal(0, 0.05, 400)

model = BeamFeatRegressor(max_depth=2, beam_width=25, random_state=0).fit(X, y)
print(model.equation())
print(model.fdr_controlled_)
```

```text
y = 0.9999*(x0 * x1) - 0.003943   [1 of 25 certified terms; parsimony=None prints all 25]
True
```

Three things matter. `equation()` is the fitted model itself — evaluate it on
raw feature values and you reproduce `predict()`. `fdr_controlled_` states
whether the features carry the false-discovery-rate guarantee; check it before
treating them as statistically vetted. And the suffix says that those two do
not describe the same set of terms.

That last point has an attribute as well as a suffix, because a script never
reads the printed string:

```python
print(model.fdr_controlled_, "|", model.fdr_scope_)
```

```text
True | screened set
```

`fdr_controlled_` says whether there is a guarantee. `fdr_scope_` says what it
is over: `"screened set"` when the printed terms were pruned from a larger
certified set, `"printed equation"` when the guarantee covers the terms you
are looking at, `None` when there is no guarantee to scope. Branch on
`fdr_scope_`, not on the equation text.

## Why the equation says "1 of 25"

Screening certified twenty-five formulas. On a strong signal the marginal
null correctly passes every near-duplicate of the true feature — each one
really is associated with the target — so twenty-five is the honest size of
the certified set. A parsimony step then keeps the compact predictive subset
and fits that, because an equation of dozens of near-duplicate terms defeats
the interpretability the library exists for.

The subset is chosen on the rows selection already used, so the q-level
guarantee covers the twenty-five it came from and not the one that survived.
That is what the suffix records, and `fdp_inflation_` prices it:

```python
print(model.fdp_inflation_)
```

```text
25.0
```

|S|/|S'|, the factor by which pruning can inflate the realised false
discovery proportion, since the denominator shrinks faster than the numerator
can. Set `parsimony=None` to fit the screened set entire, at which point the
printed equation *is* the certified object and the suffix disappears:

```python
full = BeamFeatRegressor(max_depth=2, beam_width=25, random_state=0,
                         parsimony=None).fit(X, y)
print(full.n_features_out_)
print(full.equation(max_terms=3))
```

```text
25
y = 1.077*(x0 * x1) - 0.2264*(x0 * sqrt(x1)) - 0.5879*(sqrt(x1) - 1/(x0)) + 0.09804
```

What the default costs you in fit is small, and measured rather than asserted:
about a thousandth of held-out R² across 308 paired fits, for an equation some
twenty-five times shorter, with no case where pruning inflated the realised
false discovery proportion. The measurement is
`benchmarks/PARSIMONY_COST.md`. Short *and* certified costs rows instead of
the guarantee: see `parsimony_holdout` on the
[guarantees page](guarantees.md).

## Column names flow into formulas

Fit on a DataFrame and formulas use your names:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({"mass": rng.uniform(1, 5, 300),
                   "vol":  rng.uniform(1, 5, 300)})
target = df["mass"] / df["vol"] + rng.normal(0, 0.02, 300)
print(BeamFeatRegressor(random_state=0).fit(df, target).formulas())
```

```text
['(mass / vol)']
```

## Dimensional analysis

Give units as pint quantities or plain strings; dimensionally invalid
expressions (metres plus kilograms) are rejected before any numerical work — so `x0 + x1` (kg plus m) is never even scored:

```python
y_phys = X[:, 0] * X[:, 1] / X[:, 2]          # kg·m/s
model = BeamFeatRegressor(
    units={"x0": "kg", "x1": "m", "x2": "s"}, random_state=0
).fit(X[:, :3], y_phys)
print(model.formulas())
```

```text
['((x1 / x2) * x0)']
```

The recovered form, kg·m/s, is exactly the target's dimension — and the
dimensionally invalid spellings never consumed a beam slot.

Cover every column. A column without a unit is dimensionally
unconstrained, so it combines freely with the labelled ones and the check
stops binding on exactly the columns you did not vouch for — labelling your
real measurements and leaving the noise blank is the case worth naming,
because it looks careful and is not. Give the genuinely unitless columns
`"dimensionless"`; the estimator warns when coverage is partial, and raises
when the keys match no column at all. Keys are column names, so a DataFrame
lets you write `{"rho": "kg/m**3"}` rather than `{"x0": ...}`.

## Columns that carry no data

A column with no variation cannot be selected — it standardises to zeros, so
its association with the target is zero wherever it appears. That is the right
outcome and costs nothing, but in the output it looks the same as a column
that simply does not matter, so it is reported:

```text
beamfeat: 55 of 521 columns are constant (WAP003, WAP004, WAP092, ...) and
cannot be selected. They are ignored and cost nothing, but check whether they
are meant to carry data.
```

Constancy is relative to the column's magnitude, not an absolute floor on the
spread — a column varying over 0 to 1e-9 has a smaller variance than a stuck
sensor reading 9.81, and only the second is constant. Use `is_constant` to
apply the same test when screening a table before fitting.

A constant with a genuine unit is a different matter: gravity is m/s² whether
or not it varies, and expressions built from it are unit-checked, so label it.
Its absence from a recovered formula is not a miss — a multiplicative constant
is absorbed into the fitted coefficient rather than returned as a symbol.

## Audit what selection did

Every candidate's exact p-value and q-value is kept:

```python
for row in model.selection_report_[:3]:
    print(row["formula"], round(row["q_value"], 4), row["kept"])
```

Features are *kept* only if they pass FDR screening at `target_fdr`
(default 0.1, Benjamini–Yekutieli) on a held-out split, then survive the
parsimony pass. `screened` marks the certified set, which is what the
guarantee covers; `kept` marks the compact subset the equation prints. Set
`parsimony=None` and the two agree.

## Honest failure, by default

On a target with no structure, nothing passes — and the model says so
instead of returning junk:

```python
noise = rng.standard_normal(400)
model = BeamFeatRegressor(random_state=3).fit(X, noise)
# NoDiscoveriesWarning: ... Returning no constructed features ...
print(model.equation())
```

```text
y = 0.0353  (no feature passed selection)
```

Prefer the old behaviour? `on_no_discoveries="fallback"` keeps the
unfiltered search output (flagged `fdr_controlled_=False`); `"raise"`
raises.

## Classification

```python
from beamfeat import BeamFeatClassifier

labels = (X[:, 0] * X[:, 1] > X[:, 2] * X[:, 3]).astype(int)
clf = BeamFeatClassifier(max_depth=2, random_state=0).fit(X, labels)
print(clf.equation())          # log-odds form; boundary = zero level set
```

## Real data with missing values or categoricals

beamfeat never imputes or encodes silently — compose explicitly:

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

pipe = make_pipeline(SimpleImputer(strategy="median"),
                     BeamFeatRegressor(random_state=0))
```

## When to reach for something else

If a tree model beats beamfeat by a wide margin, your signal is likely
piecewise, not algebraic — use the tree. If you need constants fitted
*inside* expressions (`exp(-3.2*x)`), use a symbolic regressor such as
PySR. The [guarantees page](guarantees.md) states every boundary with the
measurement behind it.
